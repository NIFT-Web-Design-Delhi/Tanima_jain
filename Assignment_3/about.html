         <p>The Thewa art originated in Pratapgarh (Rajasthan) about 400 years ago. The Thewa is one such artwork that originated during the Mughal period, in the Pratapgarh district of the royal state of Rajasthan in India.  </p>
         <p>The Raj Soni family ancestor, Nathu Lal soni was the first goldsmith who initiated this art in 1707. In the late 19th and early 20th century Thewa work was erroneously described as a form of enamelling by the surveyors of arts and crafts of India.</p>
         <p>A 23 karat gold metal sheet is traced with patterns which are mythological, religious or depicting daily events. Artisans also take inspiration from miniature paintings.</p>
