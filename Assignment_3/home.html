      <p>Thewa comes from two words of the local dialect, ‘Tharna’ – meaning to hammer (to get thin foils of gold from very small quantity of the metal) and ‘Vada’ – meaning silver wire (which in the loop form makes the resting foundation for the main piece), both being the most important aspects of the art.</p>
      <p>Thewa is a special art of jewelry making which involves embossing of intricately worked-out sheet gold on molten glass. It evolved in Pratapgarh district, Rajasthan India. Its origin dates back to the Mughal age. Other Origin: THEWA is a word from the local Rajasthani language which literally means “SETTING”. Thewa is thus an art of fusing 23ct gold with multicolored glass. It is a very detailed and intricate process that takes several days to complete one article.</p>

  <p class= "para1"> To create the pierced work design, blank 23 karat gold foil sheets somewhat longer than the final result are fixed on a working surface - a board covered with a layer of lac. The lac is warmed and the metal is pressed lightly onto it. When cold, the lac hardens and holds the gold foil, its resistance supporting the pressure on the metal during work. </p>

      <h1>Therna</h1>
      <p>THEWA  comes from two words of the local dialect, ‘Tharna’ & 'wada'. It is a very detailed and intricate process. A 23ct gold piece is first beaten into a very thin sheet. This gold sheet, is called “Thewa Ki Patti”, and this process of hammering the sheet is called, Therna or tharna.</p>

      <h1>Sticking on Raal</h1>
      <p>“Thewa Ki Patti” is fixed to a lac-resin compound spread on a board by slightly warming the lac and then pressing the gold sheet onto it. This compound is called, 'raal'. When cold, the lac hardens and holds the gold foil, its resistance supporting the pressure on the metal during work.</p>

      <h1>Pattern Making</h1>
      <p> An open work pattern is carved on these gold sheets placed on the lac-resin covered board by marking the intricate design. Subjects are drawn on the gold surface with a pointed steel scriber (tankla). The designs commonly used can be divided into two main groups - mythological (or religious) and secular.</p>

      <h1>Katarna</h1>
      <p>The entire background of the design is chiselled out and through these openings the colored glass is seen in the result. This finished worksheet is heated and carefully stripped from the lac surface and cleaned. Once pinned together over the mica, the two metals can be easily soldered and the mica is then removed.The surplus metal outside the design frame is trimmed away.</p>

     <h1>Hammering </h1>
     <p>The entire jali is then laid out in a frame of silver wire called “vaada” to lessen the risk of damage. The silver wire frame used in this task is pre-assembled on brass dies and soldered to precision.The delicate entity so obtained is then placed on a piece of colored Belgian glass using am bonding technique that remains to be a unique secret within the family.</p>
